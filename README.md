# AudioNarrator---Text-to-Speech-Converter
AudioNarrator is a project leveraging AWS services to convert text files (such as blogs, articles, or book excerpts) into high-quality speech. This tool uses Amazon Polly for text-to-speech synthesis, making written content accessible to a wider audience, including those who prefer listening over reading.
